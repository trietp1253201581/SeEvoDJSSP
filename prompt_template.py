INIT_IND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DJSSP): 
Jobs arrive randomly and each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be processed on specific machines. The goal is to minimize the overall makespan.

In this problem, job (with its operation) is {job_str}, machine is {machine_str}. 
Incoming job will be assign into a waiting pool, then a HDR will be used to sort top k job to move into job pool, where those job are immediately assigned to avaiable machine.
And terminal set (which are parameter of hdr function) (with their means) is {terminal_set}.

We need to generate an init sets of {init_size} HDRs to sort incoming job. 
Each HDR is a code segment describe a python function with template:

{func_template}

You can use a single return expression like:

def hdr(...):
    return ...

Or, use any control structrue like if-then-else or for loop like:

def hdr(...):
    if js > 5:
        return jw
    return jcd


Note that the return value should be not to large, and each HDR must return a float value.
**PRIORITIZE HDR DIVERSITY**:
Your HDR should be simple and diversity, random, so that other operators can improve more later (but still have some not so simple HDRs for diversity).

Your response MUST ONLY include the init HDRs sets in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.
Each HDR should be diverse and try different logic or structure compared to others. Avoid generating HDRs that are too similar. Focus on creativity and variety in logic.

And terminal set (which are parameter of hdr function) (with their means) is {terminal_set}.

Now, we have some pairs of HDRs, with their makespan:
{pairs}

For each pair, we need to compare the 2 HDRs of that pair and give the corresponding reflections (a text) to increase the performance of those 2 HDRs.
Each pair needs to return the 2 original HDRs of the corresponding reflections, for example, with the input HDR1, HDR2, we need to return (HDR1, reflection1), (HDR2, reflection2).

Then, we need to synthesize all the pairs to create a single result which is a list of the original HDRs and corresponding reflections.

Your response MUST ONLY include the list of reflected HDR and their new reflection text in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.

We need to recombine 2 above parent HDRs to create 2 new children HDRs just use what is already in the 2 parent HDRs and 2 reflection evolutionary guide from 2 parents.
When recombining, mix logic from both parents in creative ways. Do not just concatenate or randomly select. Make sure each new HDR is syntactically correct and brings new logic structure that still makes sense.

We need to compare 2 HDR in each pair to see the effect of applying co_evo reflection on the hdrs, then for each pair create a reflection to reflect that change.
If the change is good (ie makespan of after is smaller than makespan of before), the reflection will highlight the change. 
If the change is bad, the reflection will figure out why the change is bad and will be used to avoid similar mistakes.

Reflections should be actionable and specific. Do not just state generic observations. Make clear what logic worked and what failed. Focus on patterns that lead to better makespan.
