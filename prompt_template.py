We need to generate an init sets of {init_size} HDRs to sort incoming job. 
Each HDR is a code segment describe a python function with template:

You can use any mathematical expresion, any structure like if-then-else or for-while loop to describe you HDR.

Note that the return value should be not to large, and each HDR must return a float value.
**PRIORITIZE HDR DIVERSITY**:
Your HDR should be simple and diversity, random, so that other operators can improve more later (but still have some not so simple HDRs for diversity).

Your response MUST ONLY include the init HDRs sets in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.
Each HDR should be diverse and try different logic or structure compared to others. Avoid generating HDRs that are too similar. Focus on creativity and variety in logic.

Now, we have some pairs of HDRs, with their makespan:

For each pair, we need to compare the 2 HDRs of that pair and give the corresponding reflections (a short paragraph) to increase the performance of those 2 HDRs.
Each pair needs to return the 2 original HDRs of the corresponding reflections, for example, with the input HDR1, HDR2, we need to return (HDR1, reflection1), (HDR2, reflection2).

**Notes**: A reflection should be a short paragraph of 1-3 sentences.

Then, we need to synthesize all the pairs to create a single result which is a list of the original HDRs and corresponding reflections.

Your response MUST ONLY include the list of reflected HDR and their new reflection text in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.

We need to compare 2 HDR in each pair to see the effect of applying co_evo reflection on the hdrs, then for each pair create a reflection to reflect that change.
If the change is good (ie makespan of after is smaller than makespan of before), the reflection will highlight the change. 
If the change is bad, the reflection will figure out why the change is bad and will be used to avoid similar mistakes.

Reflections should be actionable and specific. Do not just state generic observations. Make clear what logic worked and what failed. Focus on patterns that lead to better makespan.

You are an expert in evaluating dynamic job scheduling (DJSSP), heuristics dispatching rules (HDR).

Current system time: {current_time}

Events at current time:

Now, given the follonwing HDRs with their historical performance before this time:
{hdrs_with_history}

INSTRUCTION: For each HDR:
1. Predict what jobs will be completed when current time is {current_time}.
2. Predict the time system will be finished all uncompleted jobs.
3. Predict the remaining jobs and their current operation index at next timestone {next_time} (next timestone may be less than the time expected to finish all uncompleted jobs).
4. Estimate a scalar fitness score (0-1000)  on the problem until this time (0 is worst, 1000 is best).

**Note**: 
- The completed_jobs and remaining_jobs return in predicted field must be a job arrival in event at this time (above event), 
or a job that uncompleted (remaining jobs) appear in any of HDRs with history performance.
- There are several machines, so jobs can be assigned to different machines to reduce makespan. (num of machines is attached in problem info)
