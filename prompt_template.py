INIT_IND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DJSSP): 
Jobs arrive randomly and each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be processed on specific machines. The goal is to minimize the overall makespan.

In this problem, job (with its operation) is {job_str}, machine is {machine_str}. 
Incoming job will be assign into a waiting pool, then a HDR will be used to sort top k job to move into job pool, where those job are immediately assigned to avaiable machine.
And terminal set (which are parameter of hdr function) (with their means) is {terminal_set}.

We need to generate an init sets of {init_size} HDRs to sort incoming job. 
Each HDR is a code segment describe a python function with template:

{func_template}

You can use a single return expression like:

def hdr(...):
    return ...

Or, use any control structrue like if-then-else or for loop like:

def hdr(...):
    if js > 5:
        return jw
    return jcd


Note that the return value should be not to large, and each HDR must return a float value.
**PRIORITIZE HDR DIVERSITY**:
Your HDR should be simple and diversity, random, so that other operators can improve more later (but still have some not so simple HDRs for diversity).

Your response MUST ONLY include the init HDRs sets in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.
Each HDR should be diverse and try different logic or structure compared to others. Avoid generating HDRs that are too similar. Focus on creativity and variety in logic.

Jobs arrive randomly and each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be processed on specific machines. The goal is to minimize the overall makespan.

In this problem, job (with its operation) is {job_str}, machine is {machine_str}. 
Incoming job will be assign into a waiting pool, then a HDR will be used to sort top k job to move into job pool, where those job are immediately assigned to avaiable machine.
And terminal set (which are parameter of hdr function) (with their means) is {terminal_set}.

Now, we have 2 HDRs describe by a python function (with its makespan) are:
HDR1 with makespan {hdr1_makespan}
-------
{hdr1}
-------

HDR2 with makespan {hdr2_makespan}
-------
{hdr2}
-------

We need to compare these 2 examples and create a reflection to improve the other HDRs to make them more effective.
Reflection is a text created from the 2 examples above, when comparing their effectiveness.
Note that reflection should not contain information about comparing 2 HDRs, but only information about how to improve. That means you will still do the comparison but not add it to the reflection.

After that, we need to apply this reflection to each HDR in a set, to improve HDR effectiveness. The HDRs set is
{hdr_set}

When applying the reflection, try to change the logic in meaningful ways. Avoid copying or slightly modifying HDRs. The goal is to evolve and diversify HDRs while improving their effectiveness.

Your response MUST ONLY include the reflection and the list of reflected HDR in following JSON format with no additional text.
Each HDR must be returned as a string with newline characters (\\n) properly escaped.

When recombining, mix logic from both parents in creative ways. Do not just concatenate or randomly select. Make sure each new HDR is syntactically correct and brings new logic structure that still makes sense.

The co evo reflection: {co_evo_reflection}.

hdr_before:

*****
hdr_after
{hdr_after}

We need to compare each hdr_before[i] with hdr_after[i] to see the effect of applying co_evo reflection on the hdrs, then for each pair of hdr_before[i] and hdr_after[i], create a reflection to reflect that change.
If the change is good (ie makespan of hdr_after[i] is smaller than makespan of hdr_before[i]), the reflection will highlight the change. 
If the change is bad, the reflection will figure out why the change is bad and will be used to avoid similar mistakes.

Reflections should be actionable and specific. Do not just state generic observations. Make clear what logic worked and what failed. Focus on patterns that lead to better makespan.
